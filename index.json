We don’t have all the answers right now, and there is much more to come on this journey.⁣ ⁣ Together with our parent company, we are donating $100,000 each to The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund (@naacp_ldf), and the National Urban League (@naturbanleague), as well as matching employee contributions.⁣ ⁣ To our Tommy family around the world, we invite you to observe 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence today at 2 pm ET / 1 pm CT during the George Floyd memorial services. ⁣ ⁣ To our Black associates, we will do our best to listen, understand, and learn from each of your experiences — we stand with you. We are committing to amplify the voices of our Black associates and the Black community, and to further educate ourselves around racism and bias.⁣ ⁣ As we continue this journey, we pledge that we will be open and honest in sharing the progress we make. Stand up and speak out with us. ❤️\nA post shared by Tommy Hilfiger (@tommyhilfiger) on Jun 4, 2020 at 10:22am PDT\n \n","permalink":"https://caladazhao.github.io/blog/test/","tags":["art","good"],"title":"融融"},{"categories":["Go Language"],"contents":"Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Emphasis Emphasis, aka italics, with asterisks or underscores.\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with asterisks or underscores.\nCombined emphasis with asterisks and underscores.\nStrikethrough uses two tildes.
